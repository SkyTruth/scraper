The Skytruth Emailer System - Customized Templates

The Skytruth scraper system provides for customized alert emails through 
an installer provided collection of python string.Template objects 
(see http://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#template-strings).
The distribution has a default template provider so there is no 
requirement to customize the emails.  If the installer wishes to
do so, the procedure is to write a template provider class and then 
put the full path to that class file in settings file as the value
of variable RSS_EMAIL_TEMPLATES_MODULE, for example:

    RSS_EMAIL_TEMPLATES_MODULE = "C:\Users\Craig\EmailTemplates.py"

The template provider class has the following characteristics:
    - The name of the class is the same as the name of the file 
      without the '.py' extension.
    - The class provides two public methods: 
            get_html_templates()
            get_text_templates()
    - Each method returns a python dictionary mapping template names to 
      template strings.

An example template provider class is in nrc/DefaultEmailTemplates.py.
This file can be copied and used as a starting point for developing a 
modified set of templates.

The two template provider methods each return a mapping of the names
'header', 'message', 'footer', 'body', 'item', 'confirm', and 
'notice_overflow'.  As indicated by the method names, one method maps these
names to template strings using html formatted text and the other maps them 
to format strings in plain text.  This allows the emails to be accepted by 
a wide variety of email readers.

There are two different messages sent by the Emailer system.  The first email
is a confirmation message sent to a new subscriber.  The system requires an
affirmative response before sending alert emails.  The confirmation email
uses the 'confirm' template only.  Subsequent emails are alert emails. These 
emails use the other templates except the 'message' template which is not
currently used.

Within each template string are placeholders where the emailer code will
place specific information about the alert or about alert system status.
The placeholdes begin with '$' followed by an alphanumeric identifier.
The following text describes the seven named templates and the placeholders 
that are used by each of them.

Template 'confirm' 
    The confirm template explains the confirmation process to the 
    user-recipient and provides a url to complete the confirmation process.
    The html version provides a small map showing the region where the 
    subscription alerts originate.
    Template placeholders:
        $confirm_url
        $static_map_url (html)
        $static_map_width (html)
        $static_map_height (html)

Template 'body' 
    The 'body' template is the structural template for the four message 
    elements: header, notices, items, footer.  It determines the order of
    the elements and can provide spacing or other decorative elements.

    Template placeholders:
        $header
        $notices
        $items
        $footer

Template 'header' 
    The 'header' template stores the text that will appear at the top of
    the message.  In html this includes a small map of the alert region.
    Except for the map, this template is a static element.

    Template placeholders:
        $static_map_url (html only)
        $static_map_width (html only)
        $static_map_height (htm only)

Template 'notice_overflow'
    The 'notice_overflow' template is included in the message when there are 
    more alerts than the Emailer system allows in one message.  It informs 
    the user-recipient that there are more alerts than he is seeing in the 
    message, and suggests some remedies.  The placeholder reports the number
    of alerts in the current message which is also the Emailer system limit.

    Template placeholders:
        $new_item_count

Template 'item' 
    The 'item' template is repeated one for each alert item.  It formats the 
    three parts of the alert, the title, summary, and tags.  In the html 
    template there is also a link so the user-recipient can click to the 
    full report.

    Template placeholders:
        $link (html only)
        $title
        $summary
        $tags

Template 'footer' 
    The 'footer' template stores the text that will appear at the bottom
    of the alert email.  It is static except for the unsubscribe_url which
    allows the user-recipient to unsubscribe from the alerts Emailer system.

    Template placeholders:
        $unsubscribe_url

Template 'message' 
    The 'message' template formats a generic message to the user-recipient.  
    It is not currently in use.

    Template placeholders:
        $message_text
