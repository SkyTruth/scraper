* TODO correct google geocoding when a diff state is returned

* TODO add static map to email update

* TODO Fix NRC timestamp 5 hour offset problem
    think problem is MYSQL and diff timezone on ewn2 vs. local
    can we override TZ in mysql datetime?

* TODO fix tag filter query and change index type so that it can be used (like region)
    IMPORTANT: CASE INSENSITIVE!

* TODO Add source item id for RSS, PA and WV scrapers

* IN DEVELOPMENT Sites Feature
    ON insert to feedentry - test to see if lat/lng is within the geometry of an existing site.  If so, then store the id of that site
    If no site is found, create a new site at this location of the feedentry, use the UUID of the feedentry as the id of the site
    site is created with a 500m radius around the center point
    Consider updating the center point of the site once there are multiple associated feedentries - compute some sort of centroid
    
    DO NOT associate sites for feedentries with location approximated from city_state or zip
    
* Change feedentry.id from varchar to uuid

    TODO: Determine if the trigger will need to be changed - need to replicate the trigger locally and try it
    TODO: Make sure the insert rules are not being used and then delete them
    
    // Setp 1 - crate new column, populate and index    ALTER TABLE feedentry  ADD COLUMN id_new uuid;    update feedentry set id_new = cast (id as uuid);    ALTER TABLE feedentry ALTER COLUMN id_new SET NOT NULL;        ALTER INDEX public.feedentry_id RENAME TO feedentry_id_old;
    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX feedentry_id  ON feedentry  USING btree  (id_new);            // Step 2 As single transaction swap new_id in to 'id'        ALTER TABLE feedentry RENAME id  TO id_old;
    ALTER TABLE feedentry RENAME id_new  TO id;
        // Step 3 Drop the old id column (and index)        ALTER TABLE feedentry DROP CASCADE COLUMN id_old;



* Add more detailed tracking for emails sent - maybe make a general logging feature in a mysql table

* put region name in RSS feed header when region filter is used

* extract feed title from RSS feed and use in email subject for subscriptions

* Add name in KML DOCUMENT tag


DONE Implement street address geocoding     
DONE Add source item id to the FeedEntry table so we can map back to NRC Report numbers
    DONE : test implementation in NrcFeedGenerator
DONE Scraper for PA Permit data
DONE Eliminate delete of subscription record when someone unsubscribes
DONE Remove SkyTruthAnalysis from alerts when there is no analysis
DONE New geotagging in skytruth blog feed
    embed geo using [] notation
DONE Data: PA Permits and Spuds
DONE Data: WV Permits
    http://www.dep.wv.gov/oil-and-gas/databaseinfo/Pages/OGD.aspx


* restrict default feed to exclude non-release and minor incidents - maybe also exclude 'drilling'

* Add "drilling activity" tag to all permits and spuds

* crowdsource tagging?  ask people to suggest a tag - pick from a list of suggest a new one

* Layout: re-work email foramt - use basecamp and mailchimp as models

* Feedback tab 
    include wish list - coming soon
* What's New section
* Description of data sources in About

* GeoCode: Add State Lease Blocks
    DONE LA
    TODO TX
    TODO MI
    TODO AL
    
* GeoCode: River mile markers

* Geocode: extract Lat/Lng in the format:
    LAT: 30N .35692'   LONG: 86W .26632'
    e.g. http://www.nrc.uscg.mil/reports/rwservlet?standard_web+inc_seq=986266


* New Map pin for EXPLICIT NRC reports

* KML: Add dattimes back in as an option - need to add a timespan somewhere
    Might want to organize in folders by month

* Activate database.purgeOldBotTaskStatus on every 100th bot run

* Add to feedentry the concept of a "related incident"

* Identify NRC numbers in descriptions of new NRC reports and create link between original and revised reports


Scraping Targets

http://www.epa.gov/enviro/geo_data.html- all kinds of enviro data including TRI, Superfund sites, NPDES info, much more.

Location-based search and results - http://www.epa.gov/enviro/index.html
KMLs by EPA region of all EPA-regulated facilities - http://www.epa.gov/enviro/html/frs_demo/geospatial_data/geo_data_regions.html


Data: USGS water alerts http://water.usgs.gov/wateralert/

Data: Find ozone air quality reports for the east coast and publish red alerts




Simple and visually succinct presentation.
The kml was very nice and I've saved it locally.

Near-term or usability suggestions:

FIXED   
1) It is a bit slow updating when zooming or panning, and I could not
tell at first if there were no incidents within the current view or if
it was still processing updates.
- Recommend a "Updating" and animated icon so users can see
information is still to arrive.



2) No indication of alert's span of dates to let a user know a) how
far back the alerts go or b) how recent they are.  Are the alerts
"ongoing", "historical", "resolved/closed"?
- Addressing this is probably a user-familiarization exercise.  It may
be that I am simply not familiar with how the NRC and NOAA report
systems work.

FIXED
3) It was difficult to tell what map-point belonged to which incident.
- An on-map or in-browser pop-up like what happens within the
GoogleEarth kml when hovering the mouse over a map-point would be
perfect.


Longer-term or further-development suggestions:
1) For USA users (and other nations as appropriate), provide users a
point of contact telephone number for further information.
- It'd be nice to have regulatory contact numbers I could call if I
was a concerned citizen.
-- However, I also recognize this could be a huge amount of work for
you to suss out the appropriate agencies for each type of incident.
--- Possibly, you could provide contact information for each state's
agency that handles environmental emergency response actions.

2) Tie into the many US EPA kml files providing information on
regulated facilities, air quality data, Superfund sites, etc.
- It might be handy for folks to see incidents alongside EPA's
register of regulated facilities or Superfund sites.
-- If not within your online Alerts map, then possibly as an option
within your kml.




DONE * BUG: Some NRC Reports fail to retrieve the full report
    Need to separate full report and materials report into separate Bots
    Then make full report fail if it gets and empty report body back
    Would be nice to have a way to count the re-tries
